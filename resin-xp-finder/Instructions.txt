# ANYCUBIC RESIN EXPOSURE FINDER by rAi
---------------------------------------------
Download and unzip the 'resin-xp-finder' folder to a USB stick

### OVERALL PROCESS ###
There are several resin test files that should work with resins with a cure time per layer between 1 and 20s.
1. Pick your desired layer thickness. 
2. Pick your desired anti-aliasing level [0,4,8]. 
3. Setup your printer for the test.
4. Print the test_file.
5. Interpret the result and find the sweet spot
6. Do a test print with your set point to confirm.
Note: All test files have 3 base layers with 100s exposure. This should create good addition and a strong 'card'. If you need to change this, see 010editor-template/README.md

### SETUP ###
- Make sure your machine is levelled before running the test
- Insert and fix the vat and build platform
- Load the vat with the resin you want to test and let the temperature stabilize

### ENABLE MACHINE TEST MODE | CRITICAL ###
- Run 'resin-calibration-setup.gcode' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder). This is critical because this setup file has some FM that prevents the print bed from lifting between trial exposures. 

### TEST YOUR RESIN ###
- Use the selected test file and print it.

### CLEAN AND CURE TEST FILM ###
At the end of the test:
- Remove the build platform.
- Rinse and wash your print following the resin's instructions. 
- UV Post-cure following the resin's instructions. 
- After curing gently peel off the test print from the build platform (you can peel before washing or curing if that is your normal workflow)
- Filter your resin and clean and your vat: The underexposed sections of the resin may create floaters or gels that will affect other prints.

### INTERPRETING THE RESULTS ###
- Write down (with a Sharpie) the resin, date, temperature.
- Resin exposure times are very sensitive to temperature. Make a note on the print at what temperature it was done.
- Resin underexposure: the small lines and details are missing 
- Resin minimum exposure: the first column were the cured graphics begin to show 
- Resin sweet-spot: the first column where you can see most of the details (the one just before the negative spaces start to get filled in)
- Resin overexposure: colunmns where the negative space gets filled in
- To know what exposure time each column represents, read the column number in seconds

### RETURN YOUR MACHINE TO PRINT MODE ###
- Run 'print-mode_restore.gcode' (also in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder), or power-cycle the printer.

### PRINT AND ENJOY ###
- Dial in your sweet exposure time back into CHITUBOX and enjoy the magic!
