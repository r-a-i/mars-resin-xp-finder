# ANYCUBIC RESIN EXPOSURE FINDER by X3msnake
---------------------------------------------
Download and unzip the 'resin-xp-finder' folder to a USB stick

### SETUP ###
- Make sure your machine is levelled before running the test
- Insert and fix the vat and build platform
- Load the vat with the resin you want to test

### ENABLE MACHINE TEST MODE ###
- Run 'resin-calibration-setup.gcode' (one of the files in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder)

### TEST YOUR RESIN ###
There are several initial resin test files that work for most resins
'resin-test-50u.B120.1-10.cbddlp'

25u/50u  - Layer height: 25/50 microns
B100 - Base Layer exposure time: 100 sec
1-10 - Exposure range time: 1 to 10 sec

### CLEAN AND CURE FILM ###
At the end of the test:
- Remove the build platform.
- Rinse and wash as directed by the resin's instructions. 
- UV Post-cure as directed by the resin's instructions. 
- After curing gently peel off the test print from the build platform.
- Clean and filter your vat: Underexposed resin may create floaters or gels that will affect other prints.

### INTERPRETING THE RESULTS ###
- Resin exposure times are very sensitive to temperature. Make a note on the print at what temperature it was done.
- Resin underexposure: the small lines and details are missing 
- Resin minimum exposure: the first column were the cured graphics begin to show 
- Resin sweet-spot: the first column where you can see most of the details (the one just before the negative spaces start to get filled in)
- Resin overexposure: colunmns where the negative space gets filled in
- To know what exposure time each column represents, read the column number (C1 = 1 second, C2 = 2 seconds...)

### RETURN YOUR MACHINE TO PRINT MODE ###
- Run 'print-mode_restore.gcode' (also in the 'resin-xp-finder' folder), or power-cycle the printer

### PRINT AND ENJOY ###
- Dial in your sweet exposure time back into CHITUBOX and enjoy the magic!
